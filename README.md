# Mowgli
A responsive design jQuery/AJAX application to interface with the JSON-based ChatElephant server.

_Currently in Planning_

Goals:

* Is designed for the protection of free speech interaction.
* Is designed to work in most PHP Linux Shared Hosting plans.
* Interfaces with the JSON-based [ChatElephant service](https://github.com/volomike/ChatElephant) hosted on ordinary shared hosting.
* Uses a KISS methodology.
* Uses the [PHP Painless Framework](https://github.com/volomike/painless) so that it is easy to comprehend and extend, and supports a potential plugin framework.
* Uses an MIT License so that others can fork and extend, make hassle-free commercial and free variations, etc.
* Tries to be very secure.
* Is easy to install. Simply unzip the project into a folder, connect to the index.php, and it will walk you through the setup scenario, build the configuration, and connect to your MySQL/MariaDB.
* Messages can only be 500 characters long. Messages are simple, support no formatting, and code can be shared via this system.
* Messages can support attachments up to a certain size if moderators permit this in a given chat room. These attachments will be removed once the message for them scrolls out of view. Acceptable attachment types are jpg, png, gif, zip, txt, and pdf only. Images will be thumbnailed. Animated gifs will automatically display without thumbnail if they are under 600x300 in size.
